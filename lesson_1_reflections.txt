How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?



    it was easier to see the bug because it pinpoints the spot for you when the IDE can't catch it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?



    it enables you to catch bugs easier. 



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?



    the pros will be that each commit makes a logical sense and easy to understand. However, it is prone to
	human error.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?



    Coding requires many files to refer to each other. Each file has many functions that are needed in
	other files. Google Docs on the other hand is usually for writing papers. Unless, each page is independent
	of one another.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?



    you use the git log command to look at all the commits made and use git diff to see what were those
	commits.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?



    You can always go back to the version without the bug.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?



    To work on collaborative projects
